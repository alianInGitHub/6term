Guide for next generations.

I was lazy to create smth great and user-friendly in appearence as I have had much more interesting tasks to do, so be confident to contribute!

1) Press "Vertices" and paint some points

2) Press "Edges" if it is avaible and paint some edges: press on source vertex and then on target - the edge is created! Also the loop validation is implememnted not in every project...

3) Press "OK" - data structures are created

4) In 2nd Lab choose the location method and press "Locate" and paint points. The result is shown in console ^_^ 

I would be very pleased if you help us to remove some defects from this projects, as the subject is rather new, so it won't be removed in nearest time.
